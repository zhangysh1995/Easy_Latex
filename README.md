## Request for Testing
First thank you for taking a look at this repo. I started this project because I couldn't get a LaTex add-on to work for my documents on Google Docs. I'm still developing this tool for it to be published in the Google Docs Marketplace.

If you are interested in an early testing of this add-on, please shoot an email to zhangysh1995@gmail.com.

If you have an idea on how to improve it, please feel free to discuss it in the [issue](https://github.com/zhangysh1995/Easy_Latex/issues).
